                    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
                    <p>Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic
                        familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming
                        content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic software),
                        and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of
                        our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>
                    <h2>Guides</h2>
                    <p>This module contains the following articles, which will take you through all the basic theory of HTML and
                        provide ample opportunity for you to test out some skills.</p>

                    <p>The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded.
                        It contains information such as the page
                        <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, links to CSS (if you want to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata
                        (data about the HTML, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document).</p>

                    <p>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics), so that the browser knows how
                        to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure
                        of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.</p>

                    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your
                        browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer
                        wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different
                        parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a bit of content
                        into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on. For example, take the
                        following line of content:</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                    <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph
                        (
                        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) element:</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                </section>
                <hr>
                <section class='sub-section'>
                    <h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>
                    <p>Let's explore our paragraph element a bit further:</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                    <p>The main parts of our element are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening
                            and closing
                            <b>angle brackets</b>. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case
                            where the start of the paragraph is.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash
                            before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph
                            is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to strange results.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>The element:</b> The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Nesting elements</h3>
                    <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called
                        <b>nesting</b>. If we wanted to state that our cat is
                        <b>very</b> grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a
                        <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                    <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested: in the example above, we opened
                        the
                        <code>p</code> element first, then the
                        <code>strong</code>> element, therefore we have to close the strong element first, then the
                        <code>p</code>. The following is incorrect:</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
                    <p>The elements have to open and close correctly, so they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they
                        overlap like above, then your web browser will try to make a best guess at what you were trying to say,
                        and you may well get unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>
                    <h3>Block versus inline elements</h3>
                    <p>There are two important categories of elements in HTML which you should know about. They are block-level
                        elements and inline elements.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page — they will appear on a new line from whatever content
                            went before it, and any content that goes after it will also appear on a new line. Block-level elements
                            tend to be structural elements on the page that represent, for example, paragraphs, lists, navigation
                            menus, footers, etc. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might
                            be nested inside another block-level element.</li>
                        <li>Inline elements are those that are contained within block-level elements and surround only small parts
                            of the document’s content, not entire paragraphs and groupings of content. An inline element will
                            not cause a new line to appear in the document; they would normally appear inside a paragraph of
                            text, for example an
                            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element (hyperlink) or emphasis elements such as
                            <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or
                            <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Take the following example:</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt;
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &lt;p&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fifth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sixth&lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                    <p><code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is an inline element, so as you can see below, the first three elements sit on the same line as one another with no space in between. On the other hand, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is a block-level element, so each element appears on a new line, with space above and below each (the spacing is due to default CSS styling that the browser applies to paragraphs).</p>
                    <h3>Empty elements</h3>
                    <p>Not all elements follow the above pattern of opening tag, content, closing tag. Some elements consist only of a single tag, which is usually used to insert/embed something in the document at the place it is included. For example, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element embeds an image file onto a page in the position it is included in:</p>
                </section>
                <hr>
                <section class='sub-section'>
                    <h2>Attributes</h2>
                    <p>Elements can also have attributes, which look like this:</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;p class="editor-note"&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;p&gt;</code>
                    <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element which you don't want to appear in the actual content. In this case, the <code>class</code> attribute allows you to give the element an identifying name that can be later used to target the element with style information and other things.</p>
                    <p>An attribute should have:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes.)</li>
                        <li>The attribute name, followed by an equals sign.</li>
                        <li>An attribute value, with opening and closing quote marks wrapped around it.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Boolean attributes</h3>
                    <p>You'll sometimes see attributes written without values — this is perfectly allowed. These are called boolean attributes, and they can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name. As an example, take the <code>disabled</code> attribute, which you can assign to form input elements if you want them to be disabled (greyed out) so the user can't enter any data in them.</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;input type="text" disabled="disabled"&gt;</code>
                    <p>As shorthand, it is perfectly allowable to write this as follows:</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;input type="text" disabled&gt;
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &lt;input type="text"&gt;
                    </code>
                    <h3>Omitting quotes around attribute values</h3>
                    <p>When you look around the World Wide Web, you'll come across all kind of strange markup styles, including attribute values without quotes. This is allowable in certain circumstances, but will break your markup in others. For example, if we revisit our link example from earlier, we could write a basic version with only the href attribute, like this:</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;a href=https://www.mozilla.org/&gt;favorite website&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                    <p>However, as soon as we add the title attribute in this style, things will go wrong:</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage&gt;favorite website&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                    <h3>Single or double quotes?</h3>
                    <p>In this article you'll notice that the attributes are all wrapped in double quotes. You might however see single quotes in some people's HTML. This is purely a matter of style, and you can feel free to choose which one you prefer. Both the following lines are equivalent:</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com"&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &lt;a href='http://www.example.com'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;
                    </code>
                    <p>You should however make sure you don't mix them together. The following will go wrong!</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                    <p>If you've used one type of quote in your HTML, you can include the other type of quote without causing any problems:</p>
                    <code class='code-block'>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com" title="Isn't this fun?"&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                    <p>However if you want to include a quote within the quotes where both the quotes are of the same type(single quote or double quote), you'll have to use HTML entities for the quotes.</p>

                    <h1>What is in the head? Metadata in HTML</h1>
                    <p class='overview'>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text
                        to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of
                        a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content?
                        A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce
                        the first two of these, and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand
                        HTML.</p>

                <p>The HTML head is the contents of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element — unlike the contents of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element (which are displayed on the page when loaded in a browser), the head's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's job is to contain metadata about the document. In the above example, the head is quite small:</p>
                <pre><code class='code-block'>
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
                        </code></pre>
                <p>In larger pages however, the head can get quite full.  Try going to some of your favorite websites and use the developer tools to check out their head contents. Our aim here is not to show you how to use everything that can possibly be put in the head, but rather to teach you how to use the major elements that you'll want to include in the head, and give you some familiarity. Let's get started.</p>

                <h2>Adding a title</h2>
                <p>We've already seen the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element in action — this can be used to add a title to the document. This however can get confused with the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element, which is used to add a top level heading to your body content — this is also sometimes referred to as the page title. But they are different things!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <code class='code-block'>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element appears on the page when loaded in the browser — generally this should be used once per page, to mark up the title of your page content (the story title, or news headline, or whatever is appropriate to your usage.)</li>
                    <li>The <code class='code-block'>&lt;title&gt;</code> element is metadata that represents the title of the overall HTML document (not the document's content.)</li>
                </ul>

                    <h1>HTML text fundamentals</h1>
                    <p class='overview'>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure and meaning (also known as semantics) so that a browser can display it correctly. This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.</p>

                <hr>
                <h2>The basics: Headings and Paragraphs</h2>
                <p>Most structured text is comprised of headings and paragraphs, irrespective of whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc. Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.</p>
                <p>In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element, like so:</p>
                <code class='code-block'>&lt;p&gt;I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                <p>Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:</p>
                <code class='code-block'>&lt;h1&gt;I am the title of the story.&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
                <p>There are six heading elements — <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h5&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>. Each element represents a different level of content in the document; <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> represents the main heading, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> represents subheadings, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> represents sub-subheadings, and so on.</p>
                <h3>Implementing structural hierarchy</h3>
                <p>As an example, in a story, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> would represent the title of the story, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>s would represent the title of each chapter and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>s would represent sub-sections of each chapter, and so on.</p>

    &lt;h1&gt;The Crushing Bore&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;By Chris Mills&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1: The dark night&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It was a dark night. Somewhere, an owl hooted. The rain lashed down on the ...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;Chapter 2: The eternal silence&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Our protagonist could not so much as a whisper out of the shadowy figure ...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;The specter speaks&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Several more hours had passed, when all of a sudden the specter sat bolt upright and exclaimed, "Please have mercy on my soul!"&lt;/p&gt;                    
                    </code></pre>
                <p>It's really up to you what exactly the elements involved represent, as long as the hierarchy makes sense. You just need to bear in mind a few best practices as you create such structures:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>Preferably you should just use a single <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> per page — this is the top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy.</li>
                        <li>Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>s to represent subheadings, followed by <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>s to represent sub-subheadings — that doesn't make sense and will lead to weird results.</li>
                        <li>Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you feel it is necessary. Documents with many levels (i.e. a deep heading hierarchy) become unwieldy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, it is advisable to spread the content over multiple pages if possible.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why do we need structure?</h3>
                <p>To answer this question, let's take a look at text-start.html — the starting point of our running example for this article (a nice hummus recipe.) You should save a copy of this file on your local machine, as you'll need it for the exercises later on. This document's body currently contains multiple pieces of content — they aren't marked up in any way, but they are separated with linebreaks (Enter/Return pressed to go onto the next line.)</p>
                <p>However, when you open the document in your browser, you'll see that the text appears as a big chunk!</p>
                <p>This is because there are no elements to give the content structure, so the browser does not know what is a heading and what is a paragraph. Furthermore:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users looking at a web page tend to scan quickly to find relevant content, often just reading the headings to begin with (we usually spend a very short time on a web page). If they can't see anything useful within a few seconds, they'll likely get frustrated and go somewhere else.</li>
                    <li>Search engines indexing your page consider the contents of headings as important keywords for influencing the page's search rankings. Without headings, your page will perform poorly in terms of SEO (Search Engine Optimization).</li>
                    <li>Severely visually impaired people often don't read web pages; they listen to them instead. This is done with software called a screen reader. This software provides ways to get fast access to given text content. Among the various techniques used, they provide an outline of the document by reading out the headings, allowing their users to find the information they need quickly. If headings are not available, they will be forced to listen to the whole document read out loud.</li>
                    <li>To style content with CSS, or make it do interesting things with JavaScript, you need to have elements wrapping the relevant content, so CSS/JavaScript can effectively target it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We therefore need to give our content structural markup.</p>
