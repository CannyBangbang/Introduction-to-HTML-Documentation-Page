                <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
                <p>Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic
                    familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming
                    content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic software),
                    and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of
                    our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>
                <h2>Guides</h2>
                <p>This module contains the following articles, which will take you through all the basic theory of HTML and
                    provide ample opportunity for you to test out some skills.</p>

                    how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way,

                <p>The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded.
                    It contains information such as the page
                    <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, links to CSS (if you want to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata
                    (data about the HTML, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document).</p>

                <p>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics), so that the browser knows how
                    to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure
                    of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.</p>

                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your
                    browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer
                    wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different
                    parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a bit of content
                    into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on. For example, take the
                    following line of content:</p>
                <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph
                    (
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) element:</p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            </section>
            <hr>
            <section class='sub-section'>
                <h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>
                <p>Let's explore our paragraph element a bit further:</p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                <p>The main parts of our element are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening
                        and closing
                        <b>angle brackets</b>. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case
                        where the start of the paragraph is.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash
                        before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph
                        is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to strange results.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>The element:</b> The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Nesting elements</h3>
                <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called
                    <b>nesting</b>. If we wanted to state that our cat is
                    <b>very</b> grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a
                    <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested: in the example above, we opened
                    the
                    <code>p</code> element first, then the
                    <code>strong</code>> element, therefore we have to close the strong element first, then the
                    <code>p</code>. The following is incorrect:</p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
                <p>The elements have to open and close correctly, so they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they
                    overlap like above, then your web browser will try to make a best guess at what you were trying to say,
                    and you may well get unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>
                <h3>Block versus inline elements</h3>
                <p>There are two important categories of elements in HTML which you should know about. They are block-level
                    elements and inline elements.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page — they will appear on a new line from whatever content
                        went before it, and any content that goes after it will also appear on a new line. Block-level elements
                        tend to be structural elements on the page that represent, for example, paragraphs, lists, navigation
                        menus, footers, etc. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might
                        be nested inside another block-level element.</li>
                    <li>Inline elements are those that are contained within block-level elements and surround only small parts
                        of the document’s content, not entire paragraphs and groupings of content. An inline element will
                        not cause a new line to appear in the document; they would normally appear inside a paragraph of
                        text, for example an
                        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element (hyperlink) or emphasis elements such as
                        <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or
                        <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Take the following example:</p>
                <code>&lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &lt;p&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fifth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sixth&lt;/p&gt;
                </code>
                <p><code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is an inline element, so as you can see below, the first three elements sit on the same line as one another with no space in between. On the other hand, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is a block-level element, so each element appears on a new line, with space above and below each (the spacing is due to default CSS styling that the browser applies to paragraphs).</p>
                <h3>Empty elements</h3>
                <p>Not all elements follow the above pattern of opening tag, content, closing tag. Some elements consist only of a single tag, which is usually used to insert/embed something in the document at the place it is included. For example, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element embeds an image file onto a page in the position it is included in:</p>
            </section>
            <hr>
            <section class='sub-section'>
                <h2>Attributes</h2>
                <p>Elements can also have attributes, which look like this:</p>
                <code>&lt;p class="editor-note"&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;p&gt;</code>
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element which you don't want to appear in the actual content. In this case, the <code>class</code> attribute allows you to give the element an identifying name that can be later used to target the element with style information and other things.</p>
                <p>An attribute should have:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes.)</li>
                    <li>The attribute name, followed by an equals sign.</li>
                    <li>An attribute value, with opening and closing quote marks wrapped around it.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Boolean attributes</h3>
                <p>You'll sometimes see attributes written without values — this is perfectly allowed. These are called boolean attributes, and they can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name. As an example, take the <code>disabled</code> attribute, which you can assign to form input elements if you want them to be disabled (greyed out) so the user can't enter any data in them.</p>
                <code>&lt;input type="text" disabled="disabled"&gt;</code>
                <p>As shorthand, it is perfectly allowable to write this as follows:</p>
                <code>&lt;input type="text" disabled&gt;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &lt;input type="text"&gt;
                </code>
                <h3>Omitting quotes around attribute values</h3>
                <p>When you look around the World Wide Web, you'll come across all kind of strange markup styles, including attribute values without quotes. This is allowable in certain circumstances, but will break your markup in others. For example, if we revisit our link example from earlier, we could write a basic version with only the href attribute, like this:</p>
                <code>&lt;a href=https://www.mozilla.org/&gt;favorite website&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                <p>However, as soon as we add the title attribute in this style, things will go wrong:</p>
                <code>&lt;a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage&gt;favorite website&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                <h3>Single or double quotes?</h3>
                <p>In this article you'll notice that the attributes are all wrapped in double quotes. You might however see single quotes in some people's HTML. This is purely a matter of style, and you can feel free to choose which one you prefer. Both the following lines are equivalent:</p>
                <code>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com"&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &lt;a href='http://www.example.com'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;
                </code>
                <p>You should however make sure you don't mix them together. The following will go wrong!</p>
                <code>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                <p>If you've used one type of quote in your HTML, you can include the other type of quote without causing any problems:</p>
                <code>&lt;a href="http://www.example.com" title="Isn't this fun?"&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                <p>However if you want to include a quote within the quotes where both the quotes are of the same type(single quote or double quote), you'll have to use HTML entities for the quotes.</p>

                <h1>What is in the head? Metadata in HTML</h1>
                <p class='overview'>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text
                    to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of
                    a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content?
                    A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce
                    the first two of these, and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand
                    HTML.</p>
